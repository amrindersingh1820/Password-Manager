"Feature","AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)","bcrypt"
"Purpose","Data encryption and decryption","Password hashing and verification"
"Type","Symmetric block cipher (encryption algorithm)","Adaptive, salted, one-way password hashing function"
"Key usage","Uses a key for both encryption and decryption; the same key must be kept secret","Does not use a key for “decryption”; instead, hashes are compared for password validation"
"Algorithm base","Operates on 128-bit blocks using keys of 128, 192, or 256 bits","Based on the Blowfish cipher; includes salt and cost factor"
"Output","Ciphertext—can be decrypted back to original data with the correct key","Hash—cannot be reversed; original password cannot be obtained from output"
"Salt","Uses IV (Initialization Vector) for block cipher modes for randomness, not traditional salt","Uses a unique random salt for each password to ensure unique hashes even for identical passwords"
"Reversibility","Reversible—data can be decrypted if you have the key","Irreversible—hash is one-way; password cannot be recovered from hash"
"Use case","Encrypting files, communications, and databases; protecting data at rest or in transit","Storing and validating user passwords securely (authentication)"
"Security strengthening","Security is based on key secrecy and proper IV management","Adjustable computational cost (“work factor”) to slow down brute-force attacks, making hashing intentionally slow"
"Vulnerabilities","Key management, IV reuse/poor entropy, implementation flaws","Outdated cost = vulnerable to faster CPUs or GPUs, but still generally safe if configured right"
"Performance","Very fast, especially with hardware acceleration","Intentionally slow, to resist brute-force attacks"
